## ViralClaw split_video Fix
- Codex agent fixed `split_video.py` — disabled dynamic zoom for `screencast_webcam`
- Commit `ee55633`: static layout (screen 60% top, webcam 40% bottom)
- Webcam crop safety margin improved (min frame 82%, headroom cy=fy+fh*0.44)
- Detection thresholds: `webcam_area_ratio < 0.012`, `corner_small_ratio >= 0.22`
- Job 36 generated with fix, uploaded to YouTube: https://youtube.com/shorts/uD2Bmekg_iQ

## Children's Book Business Idea
- André interested in AI-generated personalized children's books
- Concept: customer picks theme + uploads references → AI story + illustrations → print & ship
- 10-15 pages, pricing target R$79-149
- Print-on-demand via Gelato or Lulu APIs (~$8-15 USD softcover 20pg)
- Competitor: Dentro da História (R$99-169, template-only)
- Home printing option: Epson EcoTank on Couché 150g+ paper (~R$10-15/book)
- **Blocker**: couldn't scrape Gelato/Lulu pricing (Cloudflare 403, DNS errors)
- André confirmed interest in pricing research ("sim, e veja o preço")
