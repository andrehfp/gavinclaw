# 2026-02-04 - Session Notes

## FieldStation42 Updates
- **Shows Thematic (ch 10)**: Adjusted for heavy dramas (Vikings, Peaky Blinders) on weekend nights only (Fri/Sat/Sun after 21h)
- **Live News (ch 11)**: NEW streaming channel with DW News + NASA TV (30min rotation)
- **Marathon TV**: Moved to channel 12 (was conflicting with ch 10)
- Rebuilt catalogs and restarted service

## Movie Re-encoding Project
- Started overnight re-encoding of 7 large H.264 movies to HEVC
- Target savings: ~70GB
- Script: `/home/andreprado/scripts/reencode-movies.sh`
- Backup dir: `/mnt/ssd/media/movies/_originals_backup/`
- Telegram notifications configured for completion
- First movie: Princess Bride (19GB, ~2.7h encoding time)
- Full list: Princess Bride, Kingdom of Heaven, Paddington (1&2), Incredibles, Kung Fu Panda 3, Coco

## System Configuration
- **Chromium headless** installed via snap for browser automation
- **Heartbeat** configured (30min interval, 08:00-23:00) - TODO: set model to Haiku in openclaw.json
- **Remote power buttons disabled** via udev hwdb (more robust than logind):
  - File: `/etc/udev/hwdb.d/90-disable-remote-power.hwdb`
  - Disabled key codes: 116 (POWER), 142 (SLEEP), 143 (WAKEUP)
  - Only affects wireless remote (vendor 4037, product 2804)
  - Physical server power button remains functional

## Hardware Notes
- CPU: Intel i5-2400 (4 cores, no HT) - ~14fps x265 encoding with fast preset
- GPU: Intel HD 2000 (Sandy Bridge) - no HEVC hardware encoding
- Wireless remote: "2.4G Composite Devic" (vendor 4037, product 2804)

## Encoding Status (last update: ~01:04:16 processed)
- Princess Bride encoding in progress (PID 132244)
- Output so far: ~6.5GB at ~13880kb/s bitrate
- Speed: ~3.4fps / 0.143x realtime
- Original: 19GB → Expected output: ~8-9GB

## Pending
- Check encoding progress tomorrow morning
- **Configure heartbeat model to Haiku** (agents.defaults.heartbeat.model in openclaw.json)
- Consider adding more streaming channels if Live News works well
- Browser tool not working (CDP service timeout) - may need further config

## 2026-02-05 Updates (overflow from previous day file)

### RLM Pattern Implementation
- Created `scripts/rlm_helpers.sh` (bash) and `scripts/rlm.py` (python)
- Based on arXiv:2512.24601 (Recursive Language Models paper)
- Key insight: store long inputs as files, pass only metadata to LLM
- LLM writes code to slice/search/process instead of loading content

### Guide Improvements (FieldStation42)
- Added larger clock display (1.8x font, bold, green on dark)
- Added "now line" - red vertical line showing current time position
- Service restarted with changes

### Skills Added
- Excalidraw diagram skill from GitHub (leefowlercu/agent-skill-excalidraw-diagram-builder)
- Generated OpenClaw architecture diagram as test

### MoldaSpace Marketing
- André's project for AI architectural visualization
- Created Reddit marketing strategy with 3 posts for different subreddits
- Found fresh threads in r/SketchUp and r/archviz for commenting
