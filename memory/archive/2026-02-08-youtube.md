# 2026-02-08 - YouTube Pipeline with ViralClaw

## Key Decisions
- Abandoned custom shorts generator script (bad subtitle quality)
- Now using ViralClaw (our own product!) to generate shorts from André's YouTube videos
- Pipeline: monitor channel → ViralClaw generates 3 shorts → schedule uploads at 9h, 12h, 21h

## ViralClaw Local Setup
- API: http://localhost:8101 (prefix `/api/v1/`)
- Worker: `.venv/bin/python worker.py` in `~/Projects/viralclaw-api/`
- Docker: `viralclip-redis`, `viralclip-postgres` must be started first
- Sentry SDK was missing, installed in .venv
- Internal API key: `vc_4ee9d1b1e9644c58b2bd3be993d185fc` (10000 credits)
- Signup endpoint: `/api/v1/signup` (public path)
- Keys are HMAC-SHA256 hashed with SECRET_KEY, can't use raw DB values

## Test Job
- Job 24: generating 3 shorts from vsVOZOdXTLI (52min video)
- Detected video type: `screencast_webcam` (correct!)
- Split: screencast top (1152px) + webcam bottom (768px) = 1920 vertical
- Style: hormozi
- Status: processing (split stage, short 2 of 3)

## Server Fixes (same day)
- Bazarr was in restart loop (1447 restarts!) - old process holding port 6767
- Fixed: killed PID 1087, restarted service
- Expanded / disk: 98GB → 217GB (had 120GB unallocated in LVM)
- /mnt/ssd at 85% (264GB free)

## YouTube Thread
- André designated topic 19 in Gavin Claw group for YouTube updates
- Channel: `-1003702782668`, thread `19`

## TODO
- [ ] Wait for job 24 to finish, send results to André
- [ ] Create automated pipeline script (monitor + generate + upload)
- [ ] Set up cron jobs for monitoring and uploads
- [ ] ViralClaw services not systemd-managed yet (started manually)
