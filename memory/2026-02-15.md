## Reddit API Solution (16:40)
- Camofox click on old.reddit save button was unreliable (intermittent timeouts)
- Created `scripts/reddit_comment.py` — uses Reddit API directly with Camofox session cookies
- No PRAW needed, no OAuth app needed
- Tested: comment posted successfully on r/archviz (t1_o5k6cih)
- Updated Reddit cron (96968210) to use API script instead of browser clicks
- Camofox still used for: reading posts, checking profile, logging in
- Camofox NOT used for: submitting comments (API only)
- Increased Camofox MemoryMax from 512M to 1G
- André approved: "se funcionou use isso sempre"
