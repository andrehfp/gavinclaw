# 2026-02-17 (Tuesday)

## Session Context (carried from compaction)

### Content Engine & Dashboard
- Dashboard fully redesigned (glassmorphism dark theme, 1981 lines single HTML)
- SQLite backend: `content_engine.py` + `content-engine.db`
- Dashboard server on port 8888, BrokenPipe crash fix applied
- API response format mismatch partially fixed, needs verification via screenshot

### Instagram Pipeline
- Two accounts configured: `pessoal` (@andrefprado) and `maia` (@studio.maia.arch)
- Both `instagram_post.py` and `instagram_reel.py` accept `--account` parameter
- All 7 Instagram cron jobs updated with explicit account selection
- Warm Editorial visual style (beige #F5F0EB, dark brown serif, warm orange-brown accents)
- "Meu primeiro cliente pagou $29" quote card approved (v3)

### ViralClaw Pipeline
- Modal worker fixed (hardcoded Mac path → linux path), redeployed
- R2 URL prefix bug found: API generates `viralclaw/shorts/` but actual keys use `shorts/`
- "Parei com N8N?" video (job 48) → 5 shorts generated
- Shorts 1 & 5 scheduled on YouTube (17/02 09h & 21h BRT)
- Shorts 2/3/4 blocked: screencast webcam split fails on 720p VP9 (barras pretas)
- Transcriptions saved in PostgreSQL `transcripts` table (whisper-large-v3-turbo, PT)

### N8N Carousel
- 6 slides + 2 quote cards generated in `output/n8n-carousel/`
- Awaiting André's approval for Instagram scheduling

### Key Reminders
- LinkedIn DISCONTINUED (Feb 14 decision)
- Always run `date` before date-sensitive responses
- Always verify posts not already published before posting (avoid duplicates)
- YouTube shorts: schedule as private with publishAt, never post public directly
- Telegram topic 1691 = André pessoal | Topic 2265 = Maia/MoldaSpace

### Maia CLI (built today)
- Created unified `maia` CLI for all MoldaSpace operations
- Commands: rev, users, analytics, sprint, mission, ig status/comments, post (reel/render/image/carousel), reddit (status/list/comment)
- Symlinked to `~/.local/bin/maia`, uses `scripts/moldaspace_env/` venv
- Had to install psycopg2-binary in moldaspace_env (was missing, analytics.py was also broken when called directly)
- Fixed `os.path.abspath` → `os.path.realpath` for symlink path resolution
- Fixed reddit subcommand arg parsing (positional overlap → nargs="*")
- Performance: rev/users ~250ms, ig status ~1s, full analytics ~15s
- Updated TOOLS.md + MEMORY.md with documentation

### Pending
- [ ] Fix dashboard API format mapping (stats/scheduled/queue keys)
- [ ] Fix split_video.py for 720p VP9 webcam detection (shorts 2/3/4)
- [ ] Fix ViralClaw R2 URL prefix bug
- [ ] Integrate ViralClaw transcription retrieval into content pipeline
- [ ] Add duplicate-post check to Instagram cron jobs
- [ ] Get André's approval on N8N carousel + schedule it
### Dash CLI (built today)
- Unified dashboard: MoldaSpace + Maia IG + Twitter + Reddit + ViralClaw + System
- Progress bars for MRR ($376/$10k) and disk usage (85%)
- Each section callable individually: `dash moldaspace`, `dash system`, etc.
- Twitter parsing handles both formatted and plain x-cli output
- Reddit falls back to cached dashboard data if no Camofox session
- Symlinked to `~/.local/bin/dash`

### Pub CLI (built today)
- Created multi-platform publisher `pub` for IG, Twitter/X, Reddit
- Commands: ig, reel, tweet, thread (auto-split), reddit, schedule, history
- All posting commands have --dry-run flag (learned lesson: test tweet went live and had to delete)
- Thread auto-splitter respects paragraph breaks, sentence boundaries
- Deleted accidental test tweet (ID 2023729913438646341)
- Symlinked to `~/.local/bin/pub`
- Updated TOOLS.md + MEMORY.md

## 09:12 - Maia Morning Reel (Cron)

**Style:** Luxury master suite
**Status:** ✅ Posted successfully
**Link:** https://www.instagram.com/reel/DU28q-EDNIj/
**Media ID:** 18120326656595884
**Notes:**
- Instagram Graph API error 2207076 → fixed by re-encoding to 4Mbps (original was 12.3 Mbps) + uploading to R2 with signed URL
- `ig_post_maia.py` (instagrapi) failed: IP blocked by Instagram
- `instagram_reel.py` now works with R2 signed URL as video_url
- Previous style: Scandinavian Bedroom (Feb 15/16) — varied correctly

## MoldaSpace Strategy Session (Feb 16-17)

### Key Data Findings
- 781→808 users, 31→33 buyers (3.8%), $333 MRR
- **Multi-project correlation ≠ causation**: 1 proj = 1.4% conv, 3+ proj = 26.9%, BUT users create multiple projects because they're already engaged, not the other way around. André correctly identified this. Issue #111 closed.
- **Repeat buyers**: 10 (32% of buyers), 9 from 3+ projects group. Top: user_366 (9 purchases, $155 lifetime)
- Credit wall tracking was broken (#105, now fixed)
- Banner at render #3 already implemented (covers #106 and #108)

### Issues Closed (16 on Feb 16!)
- #83 Subscription pricing approved: Starter $6/10cr, Standard $19/40cr, Monthly $19/mo/50cr. **Dropped Pro pack** ($39/100cr) — cannibalized Monthly.
- #105 Credit wall tracking fix ✅
- #106 Render #3 nudge (banner implemented) ✅
- #108 Trial 5→3 (covered by banner) ✅
- #109 Backfill 714 signup_dates ✅
- #110 Full-screen paywall at 0 credits ✅
- #111 Multi-project incentive (correlation ≠ causation) ✅
- 9 security issues ✅

### Open Issues (5)
- #107 Email drip zero-credit users — spec done, final version in `moldaspace/content/email-drip-final.md`
- #93 Referral system
- #100 SEO programmatic pages
- #99 Blog posts SEO
- #113 CSP nonce-based security

### Email Drip Final Spec
- 3 emails: immediate (Sarah story), 24h (Sarah sequel + urgency), 72h (Marcus napkin sketch + 2 free credits)
- Sign as "André" not "MoldaSpace Team"
- 20% first-purchase discount already exists
- Numbers pull from DB in real-time
- Provider: Resend free tier (100/day)
- File: `moldaspace/content/email-drip-final.md`

### Instagram Maia Crons
- All 4 switched from Haiku to **Sonnet 4.5** (`claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`)
- Fixed `instagram_post.py`: added auto-upload via **Catbox.moe** for local files (no Imgur needed)
- Pipeline: Nano Banana Pro → local file → catbox upload → IG Graph API
- 09:00 Reel, 12:00 Carousel, 15:00 Render, 19:00 Evening

### Reddit Seeding
- 7 verified comments on Feb 16 across r/archviz, r/InteriorDesign, r/DesignMyRoom
- Karma: 5→7
- Cron runs 4x/day (09, 12, 16, 20)
- Zero MoldaSpace mentions (karma < 500 rule)
- All links tracked in MISSION_CONTROL.md

### Sprint Plan
- File: `moldaspace/plans/weekly-sprint-2026-02-17.md`
- Checkpoints: 06:00 morning briefing + 18:00 evening review (crons active)
- Priority: #107 email drip → #93 referral → #100 SEO pages

### Video Generation Discussion
- André asked about video/animation feature for MoldaSpace
- fal.ai pricing: Wan 2.5 ($0.05/s), Kling 2.5 ($0.07/s), Ovi ($0.20/video)
- 5s walkthrough: $0.25-0.35 cost. At 3 credits (~$1.43): 75-86% margin
- Render cost via KIE: $0.09 (not $0.04 as I initially thought — André corrected me)
- Image-to-video upsell makes sense: render → "Want video? 3 credits"
- André interested, exploring which model to use
- No issue created yet — waiting for André's decision on model

## 15:00 - Afternoon Session (Gavin Claw topic 2265)

### MoldaSpace Customer Research
- André asked to find customers on Instagram to follow them
- DB only has Clerk user IDs + Stripe customer IDs, no names/emails directly
- 21 paying customers found, top: user_366 (330 credits, Ponta Grossa), user_377 (250 credits, 64 projects!)
- **Blocked:** Need STRIPE_SECRET_KEY or CLERK_SECRET_KEY to resolve names/emails. André hasn't provided yet.

### Cron Updates (all MoldaSpace crons)
- Changed ALL delivery modes from "none" to "announce" → topic 2265
  - IG Reel, Carousel, Render, Evening, Reddit, Morning Briefing, Evening Review
- Upgraded models:
  - Sonnet 4 / 4.5 → **Sonnet 4.6** (`claude-sonnet-4-6`): Reddit, IG Reel, Carousel, Render, Evening, Self-improvement
  - Haiku 3.5 → **Haiku 4.5** (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`): Comments, Daily Strategy, Evening Review, YouTube pipeline
- **Sonnet 4.6 is new!** Just released. Same price as Sonnet 4 ($3/$15 per MTok). No Haiku 4.6 yet.

### Maia AI Assistant PRD (#125)
- André's idea: use Maia (Reddit persona) as in-product design assistant on MoldaSpace canvas
- Wrote detailed PRD: `moldaspace/plans/prd-maia-assistant.md`
- **4 Layers of Context:**
  1. User profile (from DB: credits, preferences inferred from prompts)
  2. Current project (canvas_nodes tree, all prompts, styles tried)
  3. Canvas state (from frontend: selected node, viewport)
  4. Visual (Vision API: render image analysis)
- **2 Levels of Memory:**
  1. Recent 20 messages per project (direct API messages)
  2. Cross-project summary via Haiku background job (maia_user_summaries)
- **3 new tables:** maia_conversations, maia_user_summaries, maia_rate_limits
- GitHub issue created: **#125** with full PRD attached as comment
- Priority order: #107 email drip → #125 Maia Assistant → #93 referral
- No competitor has AI design assistant integrated in rendering tool. Differentiation.

### PostHog Signup Bug (#126)
- PostHog reports 0 signups, DB shows 100/week (27/24h)
- Created issue #126 to fix event tracking

### Analytics Snapshot (15:42)
- **MRR: $394.80** (up from $333!)
- Revenue 24h: $42.30
- Users: 814 (+28)
- Signups 24h: 27, 7d: 100
- Pageviews 24h: 568 (was 95 two days ago — big spike!)
- SEO: 97% brand queries, non-brand still zero clicks
- Blog: 68 posts (EN 24, ES 22, PT-BR 22) via Outrank.so, ~3/day

### Instagram Competitor Analysis
- Explored archviz IG profiles from Maia's logged-in account:
  - @elarch.studio: 568K followers, 3,186 posts (verified, high-end 3D)
  - @renderweekly: 196K, community challenges ("submit to be featured")
  - @archviz.artist: 70.9K, curated + courses
  - @joao.archviz: 61.8K, Brazilian, verified
  - **@brutalistbrunch: 12.8K, only 113 posts** — AI-led architecture concepts. Best benchmark for Maia.
- Key insights: carousels dominate, community features drive growth, AI+archviz is hot niche
- Maia only follows 18 accounts — needs to follow & engage with these profiles
- André interested in growing organic traffic via IG engagement strategy

## 17:00 - Late Afternoon Session

### CLI Build Day Complete
- Built 3 CLIs in one session: `maia`, `pub`, `dash`
- All symlinked to `~/.local/bin/`, all documented in TOOLS.md
- André's verdict: remaining CLI ideas (img, fs42, vc, note, gavin) not worth building

### Model Switch Request
- André requested switching main model to **Sonnet 4.6** (`anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- Current config has no explicit `agents.defaults.model` field
- Heartbeat already on Haiku 4.5
- Need to apply config change or use session_status override
- All MoldaSpace crons already updated to Sonnet 4.6 / Haiku 4.5 earlier today

### Afternoon Render Cron Failed
- "Maia IG - Afternoon Render" (15:00) failed with `instagram_post.py --account maia` error
- André notified but no action decided yet

### System Health (last check)
- Disk: 85% used (269G free on /mnt/ssd)
- field_player: 3 procs running
- Jellyfin ffmpeg active
- No sub-agents running
- OpenClaw 2026.2.15 (latest)
