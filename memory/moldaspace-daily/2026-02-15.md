3. **Product Usage:** Dashboard is #1 page (224 pageviews), users are engaged
4. **Content Quality:** Instagram reel shows proper before/after transformation
5. **Geographic Reach:** International traffic (ES, PT-BR pages getting traction)

1. **ZERO signups in 7 days** - acquisition completely broken
2. **Revenue crash:** $49.97 MRR vs $343 target (85% decline)
3. **Instagram reach:** Only 1 follower, minimal engagement
4. **Reddit karma:** Too early to drive traffic, need 500+ karma
5. **SEO dependency:** 97% branded traffic, no non-brand discovery

## 🎯 TODAY'S TOP 3 PRIORITIES

### 1. EMERGENCY: Fix Signup Funnel 🚨
**Problem:** 0 signups in 7 days despite 310 unique visitors
**Actions:**
- Analyze conversion funnel immediately (PostHog events)
- Check if sign-up flow is broken technically
- Review onboarding friction (Issue #84)
- Deploy first-purchase discount (Issue #86)

### 2. Accelerate Reddit Karma to 500
**Problem:** Only 2 total karma, need 500 to start Phase 2
**Actions:**
- Increase cron frequency to 4x daily (current: 3x)
- Target more active threads (100+ comments)
- Provide longer, more valuable answers (current style is good)
- Focus on newer posts (<2 hours old) for visibility

### 3. Instagram Organic Boost
**Problem:** 1 follower won't generate any traffic
**Actions:**
- Post 2x today (educational content + render showcase)
- Engage with 50 architecture accounts (follow + meaningful comments)
- Use all relevant hashtags (#archviz #interiordesign #beforeandafter)
- Cross-promote to relevant Facebook architecture groups

## 📈 Strategic Notes
- **Conversion Crisis:** Getting traffic but zero signups suggests UX/pricing/value prop issues
- **Content Gap:** Reddit persona is working but needs scale (500 karma = ~3-4 weeks at current pace)
- **Revenue Discrepancy:** Mission Control shows $343 MRR but data shows $50 - investigate source of truth
- **Geographic Opportunity:** ES/PT-BR pages ranking well, could expand international content

## 🔄 Next Actions for Tomorrow
1. Fix signup conversion issue (highest priority)
2. Deploy 3-5 Reddit comments via cron
3. Instagram: 2 posts + 50 engagements
4. Email re-engagement campaign for 754 inactive users
5. Review GitHub issues #82, #83, #84 with André
