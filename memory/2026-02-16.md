## Config Changes
- **memory-lancedb plugin enabled**: `autoCapture: true`, `autoRecall: true`, embedding model `text-embedding-3-small` with OpenAI key. BUT warning says it's disabled because memory slot is set to "memory-core". Needs fix: set `plugins.slots.memory` to `memory-lancedb`.
- **Update channel switched to beta**: `update.channel: "beta"`. Currently same version as stable (2026.2.15).
- **WhatsApp channel configured**: `dmPolicy: "allowlist"`, `allowFrom: ["*"]`, `groupPolicy: "disabled"`, `selfChatMode: false`. Linked with number +5511519442XX (credentials at `~/.openclaw/credentials/whatsapp/default/`).
- **Cross-context messaging enabled**: `tools.message.crossContext.allowAcrossProviders: true` and `allowWithinProvider: true`.

## WhatsApp Rules
- **ONLY respond to**: André (+5542999240229), Priscila (+5542998386267), Lilian (+5542999051127)
- **IGNORE all other numbers** — do not reply to anyone else
- Priscila: manutenção apt (gaveta, rodapé, pistão armário cozinha)
- Lilian: correção endereço IPTU (inscrição 188912, número 160→167)
- Endereço André: Ed Platinum, Rua Venezuela 167, ap 113, Oficinas, Ponta Grossa
- Imobiliária: Conceito Imóveis
- Follow-up crons: 09h e 14h (IDs: 558f731c, 075ad78d) — desativar quando resolver

## WhatsApp Setup
- André has a separate number ready for WhatsApp bot
- QR code scanned, WhatsApp connected successfully (gateway log: "WhatsApp gateway connected")
- **BUG**: Outbound message sending fails with `TypeError: (0, _pluginSdk.resolveWhatsAppOutboundTarget) is not a function`. Affects both message tool and CLI `openclaw message send`. Inbound receiving works fine.
- André's personal WhatsApp: +5542999240229
- André wants Gavin to talk to two people at a real estate agency ("imobiliária") to solve two problems that are taking too much of his time
- Waiting for André to describe the two problems

## Streaming
- André noticed streaming doesn't work on Telegram despite `streamMode: "partial"`. Tested with long message, came all at once. Might be model/provider related (Claude Opus 4). Not a priority to fix.

## OpenClaw 2026.2.15 Notes
- Full changelog reviewed and summarized for André
- Key features: sub-sub-agents, Discord Components v2, cron webhooks, Telegram streaming fix, group chat context fix, memory-lancedb security (autoCapture requires opt-in), process supervision improvements
- Beta tag on npm points to same 2026.2.15 (no newer beta available)

## memory-lancedb Issue
- Plugin config was added but warning says: "plugin disabled (memory slot set to 'memory-core') but config is present"
- Need to set `plugins.slots.memory` to `memory-lancedb` to actually activate it
- TODO: Fix this config
- **FIXED**: Applied `plugins.slots.memory: "memory-lancedb"` via config.patch. Plugin now active.

## AI Industry Research
- **Manus acquired by Meta for $2B** — AI agent startup, "digital employee" positioning
- **OpenClaw raised from OpenAI** — agent orchestration platform
- These validate the "agent harness" thesis: value is in orchestration, not the model

## ClinicAgent Product Validation
- **Product doc v2.0 completed**: `memory/clinic-agent-product-doc.md` + HTML at `output/clinic-agent/index.html`
- **Core thesis**: LLM-native WhatsApp secretary for clinics. Integrates with existing systems (not replaces them).
- **Architecture**: Skills/connector model (like OpenClaw). Universal interface (`agenda.disponibilidade()`, `agenda.agendar()`, etc.) with system-specific connectors behind it. Browser use as universal fallback.
- **Pricing validated**: Starter R$297 (200 pac, ~66% margin), Growth R$497 (500 pac, ~60%), Pro R$697 (1000 pac, ~50%), Scale R$997 (2000 pac, ~45%). Zero setup, no commitment. Undercuts Cloudia by 34%+.
- **WhatsApp API costs**: 80%+ of clinic interactions are patient-initiated → FREE within 24h CSW. Real cost is only proactive templates (reminders R$0.04/msg, marketing R$0.36/msg).
- **LLM routing**: GPT-4o-mini for 70% (simple queries), Haiku 4.5 for 25%, Sonnet/GPT-4o for 5% edge cases.
- **First target customer**: O1 Saúde (André's own clinic in Ponta Grossa). Multidisciplinary, 13 professionals, no online scheduling.
- **Main competitor**: Cloudia (cloudia.com.br) — 1000+ clients, R$449-1039/mês, rule-based chatbot, setup R$700. ClinicAgent's edge: LLM-native, cheaper, zero setup.
- **Key insight from André**: "clínicas que pagariam isso já tem um sistema complexo" — must integrate, not replace.
- **Next step**: André has appointment at O1 Saúde in ~1 month. Prepare validation questions (which system they use, pain points, scheduling flow).

## Real Estate Vertical AI Research
- Researched Brazilian property management AI market
- Competitors: Maya/Plaza, Lais.ai, Lugui, ImobTotal — none solve proactive maintenance
- André not fully convinced about this vertical
- **Dental/medical clinic AI much stronger thesis** — André excited, pivoted to ClinicAgent

## Carnival
- Monday Feb 16 and Tuesday Feb 17 are holidays
- WhatsApp follow-up crons disabled (IDs: 558f731c, 075ad78d)
- Reactivation cron set for Wed 2026-02-18 08:00 (ID: 08dec94f)

## Harness Thesis (Key Decision)
- Value is in the **agent harness** (orchestration layer), not the model
- Models are commodity, harness is defensible
- Vertical agents beat horizontal agents for indie hackers
- André's play: pick a vertical, build the harness, swap models as needed
