## Social Media Posting Infrastructure
- LinkedIn OAuth2 completed, token at `~/.openclaw/.secrets/linkedin_token.json`
- LinkedIn posting script: `scripts/linkedin_post.py` — first post published (urn:li:share:7427424549404655617)
- Twitter/X script: `scripts/twitter_post.py` — **BLOCKED**: app has Read-only permissions, André needs to change to Read+Write and regenerate tokens
- LinkedIn app: "Gavin Claw" (Client ID: 7744k3wtv3cldi), person URN: eqDpblb7zU

## linkedin-os Skill

## ViralClaw Job #42
- Status: done (8 shorts, 364.55s, 7 credits)
- Reported to André in Telegram topic 1482
- **Cron bug**: `cron(remove, jobId:"42")` returned `removed: false` — the jobId was actually a UUID (`213a1541-...`), not "42". Burned ~30+ Opus turns before figuring it out. Lesson: always `cron(list)` to get real job IDs.

## ViralClaw Local Services
- Disabled per André's request (API, worker, Redis, Postgres containers stopped)
- Repo stays at `~/Projects/viralclip-api/`

## LinkedIn Content Ideas (André's takes)
- "Por que devs têm medo da IA" — acham que IA não entrega trabalho no nível de um senior. Estão errados.

## Key Lesson
- **Cron job IDs are UUIDs, not numeric.** When `cron(remove)` returns `removed: false`, list jobs to get the real ID. Don't keep retrying the wrong ID.
