## 1. What Makes Archviz/Interior Design Reels Go Viral

### The Viral Formula

Reels account for **50%+ of user content discovery** on Instagram (2025). They generate:
- **3x higher reach** than photo posts
- **5x more discovery** from non-followers
- **2x engagement** compared to Stories

### The 5-Step Viral Reel Structure

#### Step 1: Hook in 0–3 Seconds
The hook is everything. If you don't stop the scroll, nothing else matters.

**Proven hooks for archviz/interior design:**
- **Visual shock:** Start with the "after" — a jaw-dropping render, then rewind
- **Text hook:** Bold text on screen: "This apartment was UGLY until we did this"
- **Question hook:** "What would you change about this room?"
- **POV hook:** "POV: your architect sends you this at 2am"
- **Contrast hook:** Show the "before" mess for 1 second, then cut to beauty
- **Bold promise:** "Watch this empty room become a luxury penthouse in 15 seconds"

#### Step 2: Deliver Value Fast (3–10 seconds)
- Get to the transformation/point within 5 seconds
- Use fast cuts (0.5–1.5 sec per scene)
- Visual aids > talking heads for this niche

#### Step 3: Pacing & Transitions
- **Speed ramps:** Slow on the reveal, fast on the process
- **Beat-synced cuts:** Every cut lands on a music beat
- **Camera movement:** Smooth pans, push-ins, orbit shots (even in renders)
- **Whip transitions:** Fast camera swings between scenes
- **Match cuts:** Same camera angle, before → after

#### Step 4: Subtitles & Text Overlays
- **85% of users watch on mute** — always add captions
- Use Instagram's auto-caption or CapCut
- Bold, readable fonts (no thin scripts)
- Keep text within the safe zone (avoid top/bottom 250px)

#### Step 5: Strong CTA at the End
- "Save this for your next renovation 📌"
- "Follow @studio.maia.arch for daily design inspo"
- "Comment DREAM and I'll send you this floor plan"
- "Share with someone who needs to see this"

### What the Algorithm Rewards
- **Watch time** (completion rate is king)
- **Rewatches** (easter eggs, fast reveals people want to see again)
- **Saves & Shares** (strongest engagement signals)
- **Trending audio** usage
- **Relevance** to user interests

### What the Algorithm Penalizes
- Recycled TikToks with watermarks
- Low-resolution videos
- Generic/duplicated content
- Excessive text covering the video

## 7. Caption & Hashtag Strategy

### Caption Framework

#### Structure: Hook → Value → CTA

**Hook (first line — this shows before "more"):**
- "This room went from 0 to 100 real quick 🔥"
- "Your dream kitchen exists. Here's the proof."
- "Nobody talks about this interior design mistake…"
- "Would you live here? Be honest 👇"
- "POV: You hired an architect who actually listens"

**Value (body):**
- Brief context about the design (2–3 sentences max)
- What makes this design special
- Materials/style mentioned
- Tag the style: "Japandi meets Mediterranean warmth"

**CTA (end):**
- "Save for your renovation mood board 📌"
- "Tag someone who'd love this space"
- "Comment your favorite detail"
- "Follow for daily design renders"
- "DM 'PLAN' for a free consultation"

### Hashtag Strategy

#### Rules for 2025/2026
- Use **5–10 hashtags** per post (quality over quantity)
- Mix: 2 broad + 3 niche + 2 style-specific + 1 location + 1 branded
- Place hashtags in the **caption** (not first comment — algorithm changed)
- Rotate hashtag sets to avoid shadowban
