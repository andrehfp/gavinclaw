# Instagram Strategy — @studio.maia.arch

## Objective
Build Maia into a 10k+ follower architecture influencer in 3 months.
Convert followers into MoldaSpace users organically.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2) — NOW
**Goal:** 9-grid foundation + daily posting rhythm

### Grid Seed (first 9 posts — the "first impression")
Layout: alternating renders + text/education posts for visual variety

1. ✅ Kitchen — modern minimalist (POSTED)
2. Japandi living room
3. 🔤 Text post: "3 design mistakes I see in every apartment"
4. Bathroom — modern luxury (regenerate with better layout)
5. Home office — Scandinavian
6. 🔤 Text post: "Why I stopped using V-Ray" (hook for AI rendering convo)
7. Bedroom — minimalist warm
8. Before/after transformation (need source image)
9. 🔤 Text post: "The one question I ask every client before starting"

### Posting Schedule
- **Mon/Wed/Fri:** Render posts (portfolio)
- **Tue/Thu:** Education/opinion posts (text cards or carousels)
- **Sat:** Lifestyle or engagement (poll, Q&A, "which style?")
- **Sun:** Rest or story-only

### Time: 11:00 or 18:00 UTC-3 (peak engagement for design content)

## Phase 2: Growth Engine (Week 3-8)
**Goal:** 1k-5k followers through content + community

### Content Pillars (weekly rotation)
1. **Render Showcase** — 2-3 per week, different rooms/styles
2. **Design Hot Takes** — controversial opinions get shares
   - "Open kitchens are overrated for Brazilian apartments"
   - "Grey floors need to die"
   - "Minimalism isn't empty — it's intentional"
3. **"Redesign This"** — Take ugly/viral rooms, redesign them
   - Airbnb listings, hotel rooms, celebrity homes
   - High share potential
4. **Style Exploration** — Same room in 4+ styles (carousel)
   - "One room. Four moods." format
   - Gets saved a lot (algorithm loves saves)
5. **Process Content** — Sketch → render timelapses
   - Shows the "magic" without naming the tool

### Engagement Tactics
- Follow 20-30 architecture/design accounts daily (first 2 weeks)
- Comment genuinely on 10-15 posts daily from target audience
- Respond to every comment and DM within 4 hours
- Use Instagram polls/questions in stories daily
- Collab posts with other small architecture accounts

### Hashtag Strategy (first comment, not caption)
**Mix of 3 tiers per post:**
- 3 big (500k+): #interiordesign #architecturedesign #homedesign
- 4 medium (50k-500k): #moderninterior #archviz #kitcheninspo #scandinaviandesign  
- 3 small (5k-50k): #japandiinterior #minimalisthome #architecturerender

## Phase 3: Monetization Bridge (Week 8-12)
**Goal:** Start converting followers to MoldaSpace users

### Soft Mentions
- Stories showing "my workflow" — MoldaSpace visible on screen
- "Tool I use" highlight reel
- Answering DM questions: "I use an AI tool called MoldaSpace"
- Affiliate/referral link in bio (when ready)

### Content That Converts
- "I rendered this in 30 seconds" reel (shows speed)
- "How I present 10 options to every client" (shows volume advantage)
- "$500 render vs what I pay" comparison
- Guest post/collab with real architect who uses MoldaSpace

## KPIs to Track Weekly
| Metric | Week 1-2 | Month 1 | Month 2 | Month 3 |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|---------|
| Followers | 50 | 500 | 2,000 | 5,000+ |
| Avg likes | 5-10 | 30-50 | 100-200 | 300+ |
| Saves/post | 1-3 | 10-20 | 30-50 | 50+ |
| Profile visits/week | 50 | 300 | 1,000 | 3,000 |
| MoldaSpace signups (attributed) | 0 | 5-10 | 20-40 | 50-100 |

## Content Production Pipeline
1. Gavin generates renders via KIE.ai (batch of 5-7 per week)
2. Gavin writes captions in Maia's voice (per MAIA.md)
3. Gavin creates text/education posts (Canva-style via image gen)
4. Sends to André via Telegram topic 2265
5. André posts (until Graph API is configured)
6. Gavin monitors engagement and adjusts strategy

## Reel Ideas (high viral potential)
- "POV: Client says 'I want it modern but cozy'" → render reveal
- "Empty apartment → 5 styles in 60 seconds" → rapid slideshow
- "Architects' pet peeves" → trending audio + text overlay
- "Design a room based on a song" → creative hook
- "What $500 vs $50,000 kitchen design looks like" → contrast
