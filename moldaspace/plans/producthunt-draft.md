## First Comment (founder — post immediately)

> Hey PH! I'm André, founder of MoldaSpace.
>
> The idea came from a real pain: clients needed quick renders to validate concepts, but rendering software requires a $1,500+ GPU, weeks to learn, and annual licenses that cost more than some client projects.
>
> So I built MoldaSpace — upload a photo or sketch, pick a style, get a photorealistic render in 30 seconds. No install, no GPU, $0.47/image.
>
> 830+ users, 2,800+ renders generated. Most common feedback: "I showed my client a render during the meeting and they approved on the spot."
>
> Would love feedback from architects/designers here. What would make this actually fit your day-to-day?
