# MoldaSpace Marketing Roadmap — $10k/month

## Current: $343/month → Target: $10k/month (29x)

## The Math
- Average revenue per purchase: ~$11.60 (mix of $6 starter + $19 standard)
- To hit $10k: ~862 purchases/month
- At 4% conversion: need ~21,500 signups/month
- At current 35% visitor→signup: need ~61,000 monthly visitors
- Current: ~975 visitors/month → need **62x traffic growth**

OR (smarter path):
- Improve conversion to 10% + add subscription ($29/mo)
- 200 subscribers = $5,800/month recurring
- + 220 one-time purchases = $2,550/month
- Total: $8,350 + growing → $10k in month 6-8
