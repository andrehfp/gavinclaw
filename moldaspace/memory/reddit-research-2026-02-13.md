## Tone & Style Guide

### ✅ DO:
- Share as a user, not a marketer: "I've been using X for my projects and it's been solid"
- Lead with the result (image), mention tool casually
- Answer the specific question first, then mention tool as one option among many
- Use phrases like: "been testing this lately", "found this useful for my workflow", "switched from V-Ray to this for quick client presentations"
- Share genuine limitations: "it's not perfect for X but great for Y"
- Engage in follow-up comments genuinely

### ❌ DON'T:
- Use marketing language: "revolutionary", "game-changing", "best tool ever"
- Link directly to product website in first post
- Create posts that are obviously promotional
- Spam multiple subreddits with same content
- Ignore subreddit rules about self-promotion
- Respond to every single AI tool question (looks like a bot)

### Reddit-native voice examples:
- "just tried this AI rendering thing on a sketchup model i had lying around. took like 2 minutes vs the usual hour in vray. quality isnt the same but for client presentations? totally fine"
- "been messing with a few ai renderers. [tool name] worked best for interior stuff imo. the lighting is surprisingly good"
- "not affiliated, just a fellow architect tired of 3-hour render times lol"

## Recommended Action Plan

1. **Week 1:** Create Reddit account with designer-sounding username. Join top 5 subs. Lurk and upvote/comment genuinely on unrelated posts.
2. **Week 2:** Start answering rendering/design questions helpfully WITHOUT mentioning MoldaSpace.
3. **Week 3:** Share first "own work" render in r/archviz or r/Sketchup. If asked what tool, mention MoldaSpace casually.
4. **Week 4:** Reply to 2-3 existing "what tool?" threads with genuine comparison (mention MoldaSpace alongside V-Ray, D5, etc.)
5. **Ongoing:** Help people in r/DesignMyRoom by generating renders. Post workflow content in r/Sketchup.

**Key metric:** Build 500+ karma before any mention of MoldaSpace. Reddit's spam detection flags new accounts promoting products.
