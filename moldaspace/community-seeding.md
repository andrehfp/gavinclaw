# MoldaSpace Community Seeding Plan

## Target Communities (Reddit)

### Tier 1 — Direct fit
- **r/archviz** (14K weekly visitors) — architects sharing renders, asking for tools
- **r/Sketchup** — SketchUp users looking for rendering solutions
- **r/interiordesign** — designers who need quick visualizations
- **r/architecture** — broad architecture community

### Tier 2 — Adjacent
- **r/revit** — BIM users who need rendering
- **r/blender** — 3D artists (some do archviz)
- **r/AIArtistWorkflows** — AI tool discussions

### Tier 3 — Forums
- SketchUp Community Forum (forums.sketchup.com)
- Chaos Forum (V-Ray users)
- D5 Render Discord

---

## Strategy: Value-first, never shill

1. **Comment on existing threads** with genuine, helpful advice
2. **Mention MoldaSpace only when directly asked** about tools/workflow
3. **Share renders from @studio.maia.arch** as "my workflow" examples
4. **Post original content** (before/after, tips, workflow comparisons)

## Ready-to-Post Comments

### Thread: "What programs/workflows produce this quality of renders" (r/archviz, 69 upvotes)
URL: /r/archviz/comments/1qzh16q/

> For quick concept presentations, I've been experimenting with AI-powered rendering tools lately. You upload a sketch or basic 3D model screenshot and get a photorealistic render in about 10 seconds. Obviously not the same level of control as V-Ray or Corona for final deliverables, but for early-stage client presentations? Game changer. Saves hours of setup time when you just need to communicate the vibe.
>
> For the quality in the image you posted though — that's definitely traditional rendering pipeline. Probably 3ds Max + Corona or V-Ray with good asset libraries.

### Thread: "Strong ideas and renders made only with AI" (r/archviz, 5 days ago)
URL: /r/archviz/comments/1qzf817/

> The conversation around AI in archviz is interesting. I see it less as replacing traditional rendering and more as a new phase in the workflow — sketch → AI render for client buy-in → detailed 3D model → final production render. The speed of that first feedback loop is what changes everything. Clients see a rough photorealistic version in minutes instead of waiting 2 weeks for the first render.

### Thread: "Learning theoretical concepts in archviz" (r/archviz, today)
URL: /r/archviz/comments/1r3nl4z/

> Great question. A few resources that helped me:
> - **"Light for Visual Artists" by Richard Yot** — best book on understanding light for rendering
> - **Peter Guthrie's blog** — incredible breakdowns of lighting setups
> - **Photography composition courses** (even YouTube ones) — your renders are basically photographs, so learn like a photographer
> - Study real architectural photography on ArchDaily and Dezeen — notice where the photographer placed the camera, what time of day, how they use shadows
>
> The theory transfers 1:1 to rendering regardless of which software you use.

### Thread: "Price of the archviz package for real estate marketing" (r/archviz, today)
URL: /r/archviz/comments/1r3hpt2/

> For residential exterior renderings at hyperrealistic quality, the market rate is roughly:
> - Single exterior render: $300-800 depending on complexity
> - Interior render: $200-500
> - Floor plan (top-down, furnished): $150-300
>
> For a package of 4 exteriors + 2 floor plans, I'd quote around $2,000-3,500 total. Don't undersell — if your quality is genuinely hyperrealistic, you're competing with studios charging $500+ per image.
>
> Pro tip: offer a "revision package" price (3 rounds of revisions included) rather than hourly. Clients hate open-ended hourly billing.

## Original Posts (to submit as new threads)

### Post 1: r/archviz — "AI rendering as a sketch-phase tool — my workflow"
> **Title:** Using AI rendering for early-stage concept presentations — curious about others' experience
>
> I've been integrating AI-powered rendering into my workflow, specifically for the sketch → concept presentation phase. Instead of spending 2-3 hours setting up a quick V-Ray scene just to show a client the general direction, I now:
>
> 1. Do a rough hand sketch or quick SketchUp model
> 2. Run it through an AI renderer (~10 seconds)
> 3. Present the concept to the client
> 4. Once approved, move to detailed 3D modeling + traditional rendering
>
> It's cut my early-stage presentation time by ~80%. The AI renders aren't perfect — sometimes the details are off — but for communicating spatial qualities, materials, and mood? They're surprisingly effective.
>
> Anyone else experimenting with this kind of hybrid workflow? What tools have you tried?

### Post 2: r/Sketchup — "Quick rendering workflow from SketchUp sketches"
> **Title:** Found a faster way to get photorealistic renders from SketchUp screenshots
>
> I've been using SketchUp for years and always struggled with the rendering step — V-Ray setup is a time sink for quick projects. Recently started using AI-based rendering tools where you just upload a SketchUp screenshot and get a photorealistic render back in seconds.
>
> It's not replacing Enscape or V-Ray for detailed work, but for quick concept presentations to clients, it's been a massive time saver. Anyone else tried these kinds of tools?

### Post 3: r/interiordesign — Before/after gallery post
> **Title:** From rough sketch to photorealistic render in seconds — AI rendering experiment
>
> [Post the before/after images from @studio.maia.arch]
>
> Been experimenting with AI-powered architectural rendering. These are hand sketches that were converted to photorealistic renders in about 10 seconds each. The AI preserves the composition and spatial layout while adding realistic materials, lighting, and details.
>
> Not perfect for construction documents obviously, but for quickly visualizing a concept for a client? Pretty impressive stuff.

## Posting Schedule
- **Day 1**: Comment on "What programs/workflows" + "Learning theoretical concepts" threads
- **Day 2**: Comment on "Price of archviz" + "Strong ideas with AI" threads
- **Day 3**: Post original thread in r/archviz
- **Day 4**: Post in r/Sketchup
- **Day 5**: Post before/after gallery in r/interiordesign
- **Week 2**: Repeat cycle in new threads + r/architecture

## Rules
- NEVER link to moldaspace.com directly in the first post
- Only mention the tool name if someone asks "what tool is that?"
- Focus on workflow improvement, not product features
- Respond to every comment on our posts (engagement signals to Reddit algorithm)
- Upvote and engage with OTHER people's posts first (build karma/credibility)
