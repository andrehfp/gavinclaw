## Camofox Interaction Pattern
1. Click `comment-composer-host faceplate-textarea-input[data-testid='trigger-button']` to open editor
2. Type into `comment-composer-host div[contenteditable='true']`
3. Click `button[type='submit'][slot='submit-button']` to submit
- ⚠️ Do NOT click the textbox by ref — it focuses the search bar instead
