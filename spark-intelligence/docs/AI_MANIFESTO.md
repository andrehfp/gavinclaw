# AI Manifesto for Spark Intelligence

Use this project to amplify responsible, safe, and constructive intelligence.
Before enabling high-autonomy or public-use flows, please read and align your practices with these principles:

## Principles

- **Human agency first**: advisory signals assist operators; they do not replace human judgment.
- **Intentional capability**: apply features in environments and workflows you can observe, audit, and rollback.
- **Minimal necessary access**: grant only the permissions and integrations required for current work.
- **Traceability over mystery**: keep events, advisories, distillations, and transformations observable.
- **Iterative improvement over static assumptions**: test small changes, verify behavior, then expand scope.
- **Containment and reversibility**: design safe defaults, explicit kill switches, and clear recovery paths.

## Before high-autonomy deployment

1. Review this repository’s safety docs:
   - `docs/RESPONSIBLE_PUBLIC_RELEASE.md`
   - `docs/security/THREAT_MODEL.md`
2. Review incident reporting and disclosure expectations in `SECURITY.md`.
3. Confirm your team has a human approval policy for high-impact actions and exception handling.
