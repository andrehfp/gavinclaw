Spark Resonance - Connection depth evolution

The spark that grows brighter as resonance deepens.

States:
  ✦ Spark    (0-25%)   - Just met. Learning signals.
  ⚡ Pulse   (25-50%)  - Catching frequency. Patterns forming.
  ✺ Blaze   (50-75%)  - Burning together. I know you now.
  ☀ Radiant (75-100%) - Full sync. Deep partnership.
