# Platform-Specific Guidelines

## LinkedIn
- **Tone**: Professional but human. First-person. Storytelling > lecturing
- **Hook**: First 2 lines MUST stop the scroll. Use pattern interrupts, bold claims, or contrarian takes
- **Format**: Short paragraphs (1-2 lines). Use line breaks aggressively. 1300 chars ideal, max 3000
- **Structure**: Hook → Story/Context → Insight/Lesson → CTA or question
- **What works**: Personal stories with business lessons, contrarian takes, "here's what I learned" posts, numbered lists (5-7 items), before/after transformations
- **What doesn't**: Corporate jargon, humble brags, "I'm thrilled to announce", walls of text
- **CTA**: End with a question or invite to comment. Engagement in first hour is critical
- **Emojis**: Sparingly. 1-2 max per post. Use as visual anchors, not decoration
- **Hashtags**: 3-5 relevant ones at the end

## Twitter/X
- **Tone**: Sharp, concise, witty. Hot takes welcome
- **Hook**: First tweet must be self-contained and scroll-stopping
- **Format**: Single tweets (280 chars) or threads (5-10 tweets). Tweet 1 = hook, last tweet = CTA + plug
- **Structure**: Hook → Supporting points → Punchline or CTA
- **What works**: Contrarian takes, numbered lists, "X things I learned from Y", thread breakdowns, data/results sharing
- **What doesn't**: Generic motivational quotes, too many hashtags, begging for RTs
- **Threads**: Number them (1/7, 2/7...). Each tweet should stand alone. End with plug to product/newsletter

## Newsletter
- **Tone**: Conversational, like emailing a smart friend
- **Format**: 500-1000 words. Scannable with headers and bold
- **Structure**: Hook → Main insight (1-2 key points) → Actionable takeaway → CTA
- **What works**: One big idea per issue, personal anecdotes, practical frameworks, "here's exactly how"
- **Subject line**: Curiosity gap or specific benefit. Under 50 chars

## Instagram (Carousels)
- **Tone**: Visual-first, educational or storytelling
- **Format**: 5-10 slides. First slide = hook, last slide = CTA
- **What works**: Step-by-step guides, before/after, myth-busting, tips lists
- **Text**: Large, readable. Max 30 words per slide

## General Rules (All Platforms)
- Write in the user's language (default: PT-BR informal, "você")
- Never sound like AI. No "neste artigo vamos explorar", no corporate speak
- Adapt tone to user's voice (reference SOUL.md/USER.md personality)
- Every post must have ONE clear idea. Not two, not three. One.
- Use specifics over generalities ("grew 340% in 3 months" > "grew a lot")
