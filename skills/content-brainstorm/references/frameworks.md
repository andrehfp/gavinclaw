# Content Frameworks

## Hook Formulas
1. **Contrarian**: "Everyone says X. They're wrong. Here's why."
2. **Result**: "I did X. Here's what happened."
3. **List**: "7 things I wish I knew before X"
4. **Question**: "Why do 90% of X fail at Y?"
5. **Story**: "3 months ago I was [bad state]. Now [good state]. Here's the turn."
6. **Hot take**: "Unpopular opinion: X is overrated. Here's what actually works."
7. **Tutorial**: "How to X in Y minutes (step by step)"
8. **Comparison**: "X vs Y — which one actually works?"
9. **Mistake**: "The biggest mistake I made with X (and how I fixed it)"
10. **Data**: "I analyzed X. Here are the results."

## Content Pillars for Indie Hackers / Builders
1. **Build logs**: What you built this week, technical decisions, progress
2. **Lessons learned**: Failures, pivots, what worked and what didn't
3. **Frameworks**: Mental models, decision-making processes, playbooks
4. **Tools & stack**: What you use and why, comparisons, reviews
5. **Results & data**: Revenue, metrics, experiments with outcomes
6. **Industry takes**: Opinions on trends, contrarian views, predictions

## Repurposing Matrix
One idea can become:
- 1 Instagram caption (story angle)
- 1 Twitter thread (tactical breakdown)
- 1 Tweet (hot take / one-liner)
- 1 Newsletter section (deep dive)
- 1 Instagram carousel (visual step-by-step)
- 1 YouTube short script (60s explainer)

## Engagement Multipliers
- Ask a specific question at the end (not "what do you think?")
- Tag relevant people or tools mentioned
- Reply to every comment in the first 2 hours
- Cross-post adapted versions across platforms (don't copy-paste)
