# LinkedIn Operating System

Generate high-performing LinkedIn content using Justin Welsh's proven framework.

## Core Workflow

### 1. Define the Sub-niche
Before creating content, confirm the user's sub-niche: `[Broad Topic] → [Niche] → [Sub-niche]`
Example: Marketing → Email Marketing → Email Marketing for 7-figure business owners

If unknown, ask: "What specific audience do you serve? Be as narrow as possible."

### 2. Generate Post Ideas (Content Matrix)
Combine a **theme** from the user's niche with a **style** to create ideas.
See [references/content-matrix.md](references/content-matrix.md) for the full matrix of styles and calendar template.

### 3. Write the Post (3-Part Structure)
Every post follows: **Trailer → Meat → Summary + CTC**
See [references/copywriting.md](references/copywriting.md) for the complete copywriting framework, hook templates, and polarization principle.

### 4. Profile Optimization
When asked about profile optimization, use the profile-as-funnel approach.
See [references/profile-funnel.md](references/profile-funnel.md) for banner, tagline formula, featured section, and about section guidelines.

### 5. Growth & Engagement
For audience growth and engagement tactics.
See [references/growth-tactics.md](references/growth-tactics.md) for smart commenting, finding relevant people, content repurposing, and the 4-step engagement workflow.

## Writing Rules

1. **Polarize, don't bore.** Transform vanilla opinions into bold, specific takes.
2. **Hook in 3 lines.** Line 1 breaks the scroll. Line 2 builds intrigue. Line 3 hooks before "see more".
3. **White space is king.** Short paragraphs. One idea per line. Use line breaks liberally.
4. **End with CTC, not CTA.** Ask a question to drive comments, not clicks.
5. **Stories > facts.** Wrap lessons in relatable stories using the 7-step framework.
6. **Be relatable, not untouchable.** Share failures and struggles, not just wins.
7. **No hashtags in the post body.** They look spammy. Use them only on your profile.

## Output Format
When generating a post, output:
```
📝 POST IDEA: [theme + style combo]

[The actual post, ready to copy-paste]

🎯 Goal: [dopamine / thought leadership / email capture / product sale]
📊 Style: [observation / actionable / motivational / etc.]
```

## Selling Framework
- 80% value content, 20% selling
- Max 1 hard sell per week (Friday is ideal)
- Use "super signature" in newsletters — passive product placement at the end
- Two strategies: low-ticket tripwire funnel OR expiring offer
