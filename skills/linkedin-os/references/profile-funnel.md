# LinkedIn Profile Funnel

## Profile = Landing Page
Your profile is a funnel, not a resume. Every element should move the visitor toward action.

## The Hero Section
### Banner Image
Must answer in 2 seconds: "What does this person do?" or "Who does this person help?"
- Include: your name, what you do, who you help
- Optional: social proof (numbers, logos, testimonials)
- Clean, professional design (use Canva)

### Headshot
- Professional, well-lit, clear face
- Builds trust instantly
- No group photos, no logos, no cartoons (unless it's your brand)

## Tagline Formula
`I help/teach/coach [WHO] [DO WHAT] [HOW]`
- Keep it short — appears on every comment you make
- Be specific about who you help
- Examples:
  - "I help solo founders build $10k MRR products with AI"
  - "Helping indie hackers go from idea → revenue in 30 days"

## Featured Section
This is your CTA. Use it to:
- Link to a free resource (lead magnet) → collect emails
- Link to your product/course
- Link to your best content/newsletter signup
- Best practice: give away something valuable for FREE to build your email list

## About Section
- Expand on your tagline with proof
- Include backstory (relatable, not untouchable)
- Social proof (numbers, results, testimonials)
- End with a CTA

## Hashtags
- Pick 3-5 relevant hashtags with large followings
- Check follower count via LinkedIn search
- Align with what your prospects expect

## Inbound Funnel Flow
1. **Content** → People see your post
2. **Profile visit** → They check your profile
3. **Featured section** → They click your CTA
4. **Email capture** → You own the relationship
5. **Newsletter** → Nurture with value
6. **Product** → Convert when ready

## Outbound Strategy
- Target 10-15 prospects weekly
- Engage on their content for 2-4 months (add value, don't pitch)
- Set up Google Alerts for prospects and industry keywords
- Only reach out after establishing a rhythm of interaction
