# Content Matrix Reference

## Content Themes (customize per sub-niche)
Pick 6-10 themes relevant to your sub-niche. Examples for a tech/indie hacker:
- Building in public
- AI tools & workflows
- Pricing strategies
- Solo founder lessons
- Productivity systems
- Revenue milestones
- Hiring vs staying solo
- Tech stack decisions

## Content Styles
Combine any theme with any style to generate post ideas:

1. **Observation** — Share what you've noticed ("I've been watching X and here's what I see...")
2. **Actionable** — Step-by-step guide ("Here's exactly how to do X")
3. **Motivational** — Story-driven inspiration ("3 years ago I was broke...")
4. **Analytical** — Data/research-backed ("I analyzed 400+ X and here's what works")
5. **Contrarian** — Challenge conventional wisdom ("Stop doing X. Here's why.")
6. **X vs. Y** — Compare two approaches ("Junior devs do X. Senior devs do Y.")
7. **Present / Future** — Predict trends ("In 2 years, X will be dead. Here's what replaces it.")
8. **Listicle** — Numbered list of tips/tools ("Top 10 tools for X")

## Rapid Iteration
Pick a theme + style combo. Write the post. Examples:
- AI tools + Contrarian → "Stop using ChatGPT for coding. Here's what actually works."
- Revenue + Analytical → "I tracked every dollar for 6 months. Here's my cost breakdown."
- Building + Observation → "I noticed something about solo founders who hit $10k MRR..."
