# Copywriting Framework (Justin Welsh Method)

## The 3-Part Post Structure

Every LinkedIn post has 3 parts: **Trailer → Meat → Summary**

### Part 1: The Trailer (Hook)
The first 3 lines before "see more". Must break the scroll pattern.

**Line 1 — Scroll Stopper:** Bold, specific, curiosity-inducing.
- Use numbers: "There are 3 secrets..."
- Use contrast: "7-figure founders do X. 5-figure founders do Y."
- Use emotion: "I got fired 3 times before age 28."
- Use stakes: "This one mistake cost me $50,000."

**Line 2 — Interest Builder:** Builds on line 1, adds intrigue.
- "That most people never figure out."
- "And nobody talks about it."

**Line 3 — Hook Line:** Last line before "see more". Must compel the click.
- "Here they are 👇"
- "Let me break it down:"
- "Here's the playbook:"

### Part 2: The Meat (Content)
The actual value. What you're teaching, showing, or suggesting.
- Use bullet points or numbered lists
- Keep each point concise (1-2 sentences)
- Include specific examples, numbers, or stories
- Break up walls of text with white space

### Part 3: The Summary + CTC
Wrap it up. Summarize in 2-3 lines so skimmers get the point.
End with a **Call to Conversation (CTC)**, not a Call to Action:
- "What's your experience with this?"
- "What would you add?"
- "Drop your answer below 👇"
- "Agree or disagree?"

## Polarization Principle
Vanilla opinions get zero engagement. Transform boring takes:
- ❌ "Personal branding is becoming more important"
- ✅ "Resumes are dead. Your LinkedIn IS your resume."
- ❌ "It's helpful to hang around successful people"
- ✅ "Audit your environment. Your net worth = your network's average."

## Story Framework (7 Steps)
1. **Obstacle** — Relatable starting point
2. **Internal struggles** — How you felt
3. **External struggles** — What others could see
4. **Change event** — The decision that started transformation
5. **Spark** — The moment you knew things would change
6. **Guide** — The person who helped
7. **Result** — Where you are now

## Hook Templates
- "I [did X] in [timeframe]. Here's exactly how:"
- "[Number] things I learned after [experience]:"
- "Stop [common advice]. Do [contrarian take] instead."
- "Most [role] think [common belief]. They're wrong."
- "[Person/Company] went from [bad state] to [good state]. The secret?"
- "I studied [number] [things]. Here's what the top 1% do differently:"
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold claim]"
- "The difference between [X] and [Y]? One thing:"
