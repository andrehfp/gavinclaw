# Pricing Playbook (Sell to Rich)

## A) Tier ladder template

Use this template:

- Tier 1 (Core)
  - price:
  - buyer profile:
  - primary outcome:

- Tier 2 (Advanced)
  - price: 5x to 10x Tier 1
  - buyer profile:
  - primary outcome:
  - why it is worth more:

- Tier 3 (Premium)
  - price: 5x to 10x Tier 2
  - buyer profile:
  - primary outcome:
  - white-glove element:

- Tier 4 (Elite, optional)
  - price: 5x to 10x Tier 3
  - strict qualification:

## B) Expected demand shape

Heuristic from Hormozi-style upmarket ladder:
- many buyers at lower tier
- far fewer buyers at higher tiers
- profits concentrate at the top tiers

Simple planning assumption:
- Tier 2 take rate: ~20% of Tier 1 buyers
- Tier 3 take rate: ~20% of Tier 2 buyers
- Tier 4 take rate: ~20% of Tier 3 buyers

## C) Pricing diagnostics

- If most calls close easily and with little friction, test higher price.
- If win-rate is too low, diagnose in this order:
  1. wrong buyer segment
  2. weak offer promise
  3. weak sales process
  4. then price

## D) Premium positioning checklist

- No discount-first narrative
- No cheap visual identity cues
- Outcome clarity in first 2 lines
- Proof (results/case studies) before feature lists
- Qualification gate for premium tiers

## E) Objection handling snippets

### "Too expensive"
"Totally fair. Compared to low-cost options, we are expensive. The difference is [speed/certainty/outcome], which is why clients choose this when the cost of delay is higher than our fee."

### "I need to think"
"Makes sense. Usually this means one of two things: timing or confidence in outcome. Which one is true for you right now?"

### "I can get this cheaper"
"You probably can. The real question is whether cheaper gets the same business outcome with the same speed and risk profile."

## F) 14-day test protocol

Day 1-2: define ICP + baseline metrics
Day 3-5: launch new tier ladder
Day 6-10: run sales calls, track objections
Day 11-14: evaluate close rate, margin, delivery load

Decision after 14 days:
- keep
- raise further
- adjust offer before price
