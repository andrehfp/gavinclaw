description: Evaluate and design startup defensibility (moat/unfair advantage) using a practical strategy based on Hamilton Helmer’s 7 Powers and an early-stage layering plan. Use when discussing competitive advantage, GTM defensibility, AI startup strategy, copycat risk, or pricing/business models that incumbents struggle to copy.

# Startup Moat

Build moat strategy with blunt, execution-first analysis. Separate fake advantage from real advantage, then define a layering plan that compounds over time.

## Quick Workflow

1. Inventory current “advantages” the startup claims.
2. Run each through the 3-question defensibility test.
3. Classify into:
   - Fake advantage (accelerant only)
   - Real moat candidate (defensible)
4. Pick a lead advantage for now, usually counter-positioning in early stage.
5. Build the 90-day layering plan:
   - Counter-positioning (now)
   - Switching costs (next)
   - Network effects (next)
   - Cornered resources (later)
6. Produce a one-page moat brief with concrete actions and metrics.

## Decision Rules

- Prefer hard-to-copy constraints over “better product” claims.
- Treat first-mover, better tech, and domain knowledge as accelerants, not moat.
- Require compounding effect. If advantage does not get stronger with growth, downgrade it.
- Force a copy-test: if a funded competitor can copy in 3-6 months, it is not moat yet.

## Output Format

Return analysis with these sections:

1. **Current Claims vs Reality**
2. **3-Question Test Results**
3. **Lead Moat Strategy (Now)**
4. **Layering Plan (90 days)**
5. **Risks and Kill Criteria**
6. **Weekly Metrics**

Use concise bullets, explicit assumptions, and clear next steps.
