# Moat Framework (from the video + 7 Powers lens)

## 1) Fake Advantages (use as accelerants, not moat)

- First mover
- Better technology
- Industry/domain knowledge

Why fake alone: usually copyable, non-compounding, and weak against funded competitors.

## 2) Real Early-Stage Moats (practical first)

### A. Counter-positioning (best lead move)
A business model incumbents avoid copying because it hurts their core economics.

Examples pattern:
- Simpler product + lower price where incumbents rely on complex enterprise upsell
- Pay-as-you-go vs annual lock-in model
- Free transaction model vs fee-per-action incumbents

### B. Switching costs
Customer invests workflow/data/team habits into your product. Leaving becomes painful.

### C. Network effects
Each new user/participant increases product value for existing users.

### D. Cornered resources
Exclusive access to critical resources:
- Proprietary data
- Regulatory access
- Exclusive partnerships/distribution

## 3) Late-Stage Moats (usually after PMF)

- Scale economies
- Process power
- Brand power

## 4) 3-Question Defensibility Test

For each claimed advantage, answer:

1. Can a competitor with US$10M replicate this in 3-6 months?
2. Does this advantage get stronger as we grow?
3. Would we still keep this advantage without our current technology?

Scoring:
- Yes defensible answer = 1 point per question
- 0-1: fake/fragile
- 2: promising but incomplete
- 3: strong moat candidate

## 5) 90-Day Layering Plan Template

### Weeks 1-2: Lead with counter-positioning
- Define incumbent economic trap you exploit
- Craft offer incumbents cannot match cleanly
- Validate via 10-20 customer interviews

### Weeks 3-6: Build switching costs
- Add workflow stickiness (history, templates, team collaboration)
- Ship migration helpers in, but no export shortcuts out
- Track setup depth and recurring usage

### Weeks 7-10: Seed network effects
- Multi-party flows (customer invites client/partner/stakeholder)
- Shared artifacts and collaboration loops
- Measure value-per-user as network grows

### Weeks 11-13: Capture cornered resources
- Aggregate proprietary interaction data
- Secure exclusive channels/partners where possible
- Convert data into quality/speed advantage

## 3-question test (table as bullets)
- Claim 1: Q1/Q2/Q3 = _/_/_ -> score
- Claim 2: Q1/Q2/Q3 = _/_/_ -> score

## Layering roadmap
- 30d:
- 60d:
- 90d:

## Weekly metrics
- Retention/cohort
- Setup depth (objects/workflows created)
- Collaboration rate (invites/shared artifacts)
- Time-to-value
- Win/loss reason vs incumbents

## Kill criteria
- If no clear counter-positioning evidence in 30 days
- If switching cost metrics flat for 2 consecutive cycles
- If competitor parity reached with no data/relationship edge
