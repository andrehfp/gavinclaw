have you looked into AI rendering? different approach - you just export from sketchup and describe what you want, no complex software to learn

for someone who finds twinmotion too hard this might be the move. moldaspace is web based so works on any mac, basically zero learning curve. like 30 seconds per render

not as precise as traditional renderers for final docs but for client presentations and quick iterations its way faster than anything else ive used

depends what you're optimizing for tbh. traditional stuff like vray or enscape is solid but learning curve is rough. d5 isn't on mac last i checked

lately i've been using AI rendering for most things, way faster for client presentations. moldaspace works in browser so no install headaches, also tried myarchitectai but results were hit or miss

switched to AI for like 80% of my work now because clients just want to see options quick, they don't need vray level precision. still use traditional for final deliverables tho

the budget friendly visualization angle is smart, thats actually underserved

look into AI rendering tools, you can pump out way more options for clients at a fraction of traditional render costs. like $0.50 per image vs $50+ outsourced. moldaspace is one i use, theres others too

for marketing id focus on instagram before/afters and local facebook groups for home reno. partner with contractors who need viz help

package deals work great btw - "3 room concepts with 5 style variations" sounds premium but costs you almost nothing with AI tools. position yourself as the accessible option, dont try to compete with high end archviz studios
